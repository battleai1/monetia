# NeurotRaffic - Vertical Video Sales Funnel

## Overview

NeurotRaffic is a Telegram WebApp that delivers educational content and sales funnels through Instagram Reels-style vertical video experiences. The application features two primary flows: a sales funnel that introduces users to vertical video marketing concepts, and a training flow that provides educational lessons. The experience is optimized for mobile devices with fullscreen vertical videos (9:16 aspect ratio), swipe-based navigation, and a dark theme aesthetic inspired by Instagram Reels.

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

### Completed Implementation
- ✅ Full Instagram Reels-style UI with dark theme (black-purple gradients, neon accents)
- ✅ Vertical swipe navigation with Framer Motion gestures (drag up/down to switch reels)
- ✅ Video playback management (auto-play active reel, pause inactive)
- ✅ CTA timing system:
  - Final reels (with onCTAClick): CTA appears after 2 seconds, resets on swipe
  - Regular reels: CTA appears after 60% video progress
- ✅ Three main flows working:
  - Sales Flow: 9 reels introducing vertical video marketing
  - Training Flow: 6 educational lessons
  - Final Page: Purchase CTA with testimonials wall (20 video testimonials)
- ✅ Expandable descriptions (click anywhere on text to expand/collapse)
- ✅ Author blocks with avatars, names, Follow buttons
- ✅ Floating action buttons (like, comment, share, menu) with compact spacing
- ✅ Progress strips showing current reel position (n/N)
- ✅ Telegram WebApp integration (haptic feedback, MainButton, deep links)
- ✅ Analytics tracking (console-based, ready for production service integration)
- ✅ **Secure Telegram Authentication System**:
  - HMAC-SHA256 validation of Telegram initData using bot token
  - Middleware protection for all API endpoints
  - Automatic user creation/update on first authentication
  - Authorization header-only validation (prevents request body injection attacks)
  - PostgreSQL database with users table (telegram_id, username, firstName, lastName)
  - Drizzle ORM with DbStorage for persistent data storage
  - Debug endpoint for authentication status checking
- ✅ **Video Interaction Controls**:
  - Hold left/center of screen: pause video (no visual indicator)
  - Hold right edge of screen: 2x speed playback (no visual indicator)
  - Pointer events with smooth animations via Framer Motion
- ✅ **Share Sheet Integration**:
  - Custom bottom sheet for sharing instead of external redirect
  - Telegram chat link and share options
  - Dark themed with gradient icons
- ✅ **Instagram Reels-style Comments System**:
  - Synchronized animations: video scales to 57% and moves down 45px when comments open
  - Video becomes clean vertical rectangle with rounded corners (28px)
  - All UI elements hide during comments view (FloatingActions, captions, CTA buttons)
  - Dark theme (#262626 background) matching Instagram aesthetic
  - Drag-to-close gesture: swipe down to dismiss (offset > 100px or velocity > 500)
  - Simplified header with centered "Comments" text only
  - Modern emoji reactions bar (❤️ 🙌 🔥 👏 😢 😍 😮 😂) using system fonts (Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Noto Color Emoji)
  - Comment input with emoji picker button
  - Safe area padding for smartphone compatibility (bottom bar indicator)
  - Spring animations (damping: 35, stiffness: 400) for smooth transitions
- ✅ **Responsive Design System**:
  - Fully adaptive layout for all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Mobile (<1024px): Fullscreen vertical video experience without frame
  - Desktop (≥1024px): iPhone 17 Pro Max mockup with dynamic scaling
  - Automatic frame scaling: calculated as min(screenHeight * 0.92 / 932, screenWidth * 0.9 / 430, 1)
  - CSS variables for responsive dimensions: --viewport-height, --viewport-width, --phone-scale
  - Monetia logo scales proportionally with phone frame on desktop
  - Responsive CSS utilities with clamp() for fluid text sizing (text-responsive-*)
  - Tested and verified across iPhone SE, iPhone 13, iPad, small/large desktops
  - No horizontal scroll on any device size
  - Maintains visual fidelity of iPhone 17 Pro Max design across all screens

### Key Technical Decisions
- ReelsViewport uses cloneElement to pass isActive and onProgress props to active reel only
- Videos managed via refs - play when isActive=true, pause when false
- CTA state resets on reel deactivation to ensure proper timing on re-entry
- Text descriptions limited width (pr-16) to prevent overlap with floating buttons
- Hook overlays auto-hide after 3 seconds
- All interactive elements have data-testid attributes for testing
- **Responsive Architecture**:
  - PhoneFrame calculates optimal scale on window resize using viewport dimensions
  - Desktop: Phone frame uses CSS transform scale(var(--phone-scale)) for crisp rendering
  - Content container sized via CSS variables for consistent viewport dimensions
  - Padding heuristics: 92% screen height, 90% screen width to ensure visibility
  - Logo positioning derived from --phone-bottom CSS variable for alignment
  - Mobile/tablet: Direct fullscreen rendering without intermediate containers

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern component patterns
- Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
